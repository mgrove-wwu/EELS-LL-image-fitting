# EELS Low-Loss image fitting

This python module includes 4 different models and supports 3 different types of optimization routines to fit the models to a low-loss EELS spectrum image generated by using STEM-EELS. The fitted models can then be further investigated by using rectangular and line ROI's. The full support for the line ROI automatically fits and estimates parameter shifts of the model in use. Afterwards an indication the ROI is done by simple line markers.

The class mainly uses HyperSpy (a multi-dimensional data analysis toolbox) as the underlying python module to investigate the spectrum image and the estimation of parameter shifts (e.g. peak center, full-width-half-maxima, peak intensity, ...). It supports error estimations by spatial variance and fitting estimations during minimization using weighted Least-Squared, a MP-Fit approach or a Maximum-Likelyhood minimization to fit the low-loss model to the data of the spectrum image.

For further information on all functions and parameters used, see (http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index.html) as well as (https://www.scipy.org/docs.html) and (https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) which i want to say a special thank you and i want to recommend their work strongly!
